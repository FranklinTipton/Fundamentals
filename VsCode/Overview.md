# VSCode Fundamentals

VSCode is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) where you will write and test code. It has extensions you can download to make writing code, documentation, tests, etc easier to write by helping with syntax suggestions and highlighting based on the language you are writing in.

## Installing VSCode

You can go [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) to download VSCode for your specific OS.

## Installing Language extensions

Language extensions allow you to write code in different languages and help with code snippets, syntax highlighting, suggestions, and more.

1. To install an extension, select the **MarketPlace** icon on the left hand side of the screen.

2. Search for your language of choice in the search bar at the top of the **Extensions** tab and click install.

## Open a Project

You should have created a repository in GitHub and cloned it to your local machine. If you have not, go to the [GitHub Fundamentals page](/Github/Overview.md) and follow those instructions before moving forward.

If you have already completed those instructions, click on **File** > **Open Folder** and select your repository folder in your **Source** folder.

This will open all folders and files in VSCode and allow you to add, remove, and change what ever you need.
