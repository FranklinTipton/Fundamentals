## GitHub

GitHub is a way for you to start storing code and begin to build best practices utilizing version control and GIT. The benefits of this are:
  - Ability to contribute to same source code in a team setting.
  - Reliable storage and access (not computer specific).
  - Version control allowing you modify code, test neww features, and easily correct breaks.
  - Open source contributions (if public repository, the limit does not exist for contributors).

### Getting started

Getting started with GitHub is a simple process, siging up with an email and password.
